This wordpress theme is based on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox">Toolbox Theme</a>.

Some of the PHP files are altered but the main work is obviously in the CSS.

It is using fonts from Typekit but you can easily replace them in the CSS with Helvetica and Georgia and it should still look good.
